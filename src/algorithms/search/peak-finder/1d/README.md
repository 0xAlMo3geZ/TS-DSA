# Peak Finder (one-dimensional version)

A peak finder algorithm is designed to find a peak element in an array. A peak element in a one-dimensional array is an element that is greater than or equal to its neighbors.

## Complexity

**Time Complexity**: `O(log(n))` - since we split search area by two for every next iteration.
